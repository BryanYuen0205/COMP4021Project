# Project Description

Dive into a thrilling bullet hell experience where your reflexes and strategy are put to the ultimate test! In our game, waves of procedurally generated projectiles swarm the screen, growing in both number and speed as time ticks by. Your mission? Dodge the relentless barrage while racing to collect randomly spawning gems that boost your score.

But there’s a twist-scattered throughout the chaos are special power-ups that temporarily supercharge your movement speed. Will you harness this burst of agility to weave through danger, or will it send you hurtling into harm’s way? Every moment is a pulse-pounding challenge as you balance risk and reward, aiming for the highest score possible.

Take control with intuitive, responsive movement-navigate your way through the chaos using the arrow keys. When the action heats up and you need that extra burst of speed, hit the spacebar to activate a powerful speed boost. Use it wisely: it can help you slip through impossible gaps or, if mistimed, send you straight into danger! Mastering these controls is key to surviving the relentless onslaught and climbing the leaderboard.
